Fizz Buzz Coding Exercise

This project is a coding exercise I have done as part of a job application.

The exercise is a standard "Fizz/Buzz" problem.
The program process a series of numbers, converting:
    multiples of 3 to Fizz
    multiples of 5 to Buzz
    multiples of 15 to FizzBuzz

There is also a unit test project to make sure that the helper functions work correctly.
